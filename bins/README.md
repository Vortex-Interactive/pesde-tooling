This directory contains common Luau tooling repackaged for pesde. They can be used by running:

```sh
pesde x pesde/{TOOL}

# Or, install the tool into your project and have it accessible in PATH
pesde add --dev pesde/{TOOL}
pesde install
```

Where `{TOOL}` corresponds to the name of one of the tools present in this directory. 

If a Luau tool you would like is not present here, please open an issue or submit a PR, following the format of one of the existing tools.

<!-- TODO: Recommend contributors to read CONTRIBUTING.md when that is a thing -->
