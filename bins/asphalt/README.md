Zap is a blazingly fast networking solution for Roblox.

## Features

- Zap packs data into buffers with no overhead. The same data can be sent using a fraction of the bandwidth.
- Zap doesn't compromise on performance. Zap's packing and unpacking is typically faster than Roblox's generic encoding.
- Extended support of data types sendable through the network.
- For both the IDL and API, Zap is a joy to use. It's easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to debug. It's the best DX you'll find.
- Zap is fully secure. Buffers make reverse engineering your game's networking much harder and Zap validates all data received.
